## Topic
Implementierung eines synthesef√§higen KI-Beschleunigers auf der Basis Systolischer Arrays in SystemC

(Implementation of a synthesis-capable AI accelerator based on systolic arrays in SystemC)
## Description
**Parameterized Systolic Arrays with Ternary Arithmetic**

An implementation of parameterized systolic arrays, the balanced ternary system, its addition and multiplication in SystemC
## Encoding
| Decimal | Balanced ternary a | Balanced ternary b |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| or | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

(Decimal = Balanced ternary a + Balanced ternary b - 1)
