## Topic
Implementierung eines synthesef√§higen KI-Beschleunigers auf der Basis Systolischer Arrays in SystemC

(Implementation of a synthesis-capable AI accelerator based on systolic arrays in SystemC)
## Description
**Parameterized Systolic Arrays with Ternary Arithmetic**

An implementation of parameterized systolic arrays, the balanced ternary system, its addition and multiplication in SystemC
## Encoding
| Decimal | Balanced ternary a | Balanced ternary b |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Or | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

(Decimal = Balanced ternary a + Balanced ternary b - 1)

## Automated installation (binary, synthesis, and conversion)
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libalis/bachelor/refs/heads/main/Source%20Code/sh/install.sh | bash
```
## Manual installation (binary only)
```bash
# 1. Clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/libalis/bachelor.git
cd "bachelor/Source Code"
# 2. Compile using the defaults:
make clean
make
# Or using the dialog:
make config
# 3. Run the compiled binary:
./build/bachelor
```
